## About Us

We are an inclusive math group based at RUB.
Our goal is to empower and support women and gender minorities in the field of mathematics. We believe in the importance of collaboration, networking and mentorship to foster an inclusive and diverse mathematical community. 

**Our objectives:**

- Building collaborations: we strive to connect like-minded individuals and establish collaborations within the mathematics community.
- Networking: we provide a space for women in mathematics to connect, share experiences and exchange ideas.
- Mentorship for established and young researchers in mathematics.
