<h1>Welcome to the RUB WIM website!</h1>

<br>

We are a math group based at RUB.
Our main actvities concern building collaborations, networking, and mentorship with a focus on providing tailored resources for gender minorities in mathematics.
We subscribe to [Federico Ardilla's](https://fardila.com/) axioms for mathematical outreach and education:

- Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
- Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
- Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
- Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
