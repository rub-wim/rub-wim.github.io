<h1>Welcome to the RUB WIM website!</h1>

<br>

We are a women's math group focused on fostering networking, mentorship, and collaboration among female mathematicians.
Our goal is to empower women in mathematics by connecting them with peers, providing mentors to postdocs and graduate students, and organizing math talks to promote collaboration.
Through our activities, we create a space for women to share experiences, learn from one another, and thrive in their mathematical careers.
