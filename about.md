  We are a women's math group focused on fostering networking, mentorship, and collaboration among female mathematicians.

Our goal is to empower women in mathematics by connecting them with peers and mentors, while promoting collaboration.
Through our activities, we create a space for women and gender minorities to share experiences, learn from one another, and thrive in their mathematical careers.
