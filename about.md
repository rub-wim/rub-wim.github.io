<p class="message">
  We are a women's math group focused on fostering networking, mentorship, and collaboration among female mathematicians. 
</p>

Our goal is to empower women in mathematics by connecting them with peers, providing mentors to postdocs and graduate students, and organizing math talks to promote collaboration. In a field where women often face challenges such as being perceived as less competent, assigned administrative tasks instead of scientific projects, and encountering various forms of harassment, we aim to equip our members with the tools to navigate these obstacles and offer support in complex situations with colleagues. Through our activities, we create a space for women to share experiences, learn from one another, and thrive in their mathematical careers.
